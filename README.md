# purrs

purrs offers a development harness for [OpenResty](https://openresty.org) and [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) driven by [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/), [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) and [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) inside a local [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/).

Phew, that is a lot of jargon! Put more simply, purrs plans to offer a friendly, modern and easy-to-work-with place to get started with web development using the Lua language. As a developer harness purrs use a local Kubernetes cluster for connecting a cache (Redis), database (PostgeSQL) and dynamic web server (OpenResty) together for immediate feedback.
